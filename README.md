# react-layout-transition
Trying to make layout transitions simple

This project aims to provide React components that can :sparkles:_automagically_:sparkles: animate between changes in your layout.
Inspired by existing solutions on native platforms, it hopes to bring similar functionality and ease to the web.

These are some great pieces with example code on how to use the native platform feature
- [React Nativeâ€™s LayoutAnimation is Awesome](https://medium.com/@Jpoliachik/react-native-s-layoutanimation-is-awesome-4a4d317afd3e) - Justin Poliachik (Medium)
- [Animate all the Things. Transitions in Android](https://medium.com/@andkulikov/animate-all-the-things-transitions-in-android-914af5477d50) - Andrey Kulikov (Medium)

**Note:** This is a very early implementation so do expect loads of bugs (but also be sure to report them)

## SharedElementTransitionGroup

Currently the only provided transition component.
A container around the views to transition between that animates shared elements, between their initial and final position.
It classifies elements as shared if you mark them with the same id in both the intial and final layout component and does the rest for you.
